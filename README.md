Hello there! üëã
I'm excited to participate in Advent of Code 2023!

## Language of Choice: Python

I've decided to tackle all the Advent of Code challenges using Python. If you have any Python-related tips or if you're also using Python for Advent of Code, feel free to connect and share your insights!

Let the Pythonic coding adventure begin! üêç

## Code Structure

I'm organizing my solutions in a structured manner. Here's a glimpse:

```plaintext
.
|-- day1
|   |-- problem1
|   |   |-- problem1.in
|   |   |-- problem1.py
|   |   |-- problem1.txt
|   |-- problem2
|   |   |-- problem2.in
|   |   |-- problem2.py
|   |   |-- problem2.txt
|-- day2
...
```
